This repository contains solutions for the **Python File Handling Quiz** and **Error Handling Lab**.  
It demonstrates how to work with files in Python — including reading, writing, modifying content, and handling common errors safely.

## 🖋️ File Read & Write Challenge
The program:
1. Opens an input file (`input.txt`)
